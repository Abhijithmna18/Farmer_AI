# Payment Value Display Fix - After Admin Approval

## Problem Description
After an admin approved a booking, the payment value displayed became 0.00 instead of showing the actual payment amount. Before approval, the correct payment value was visible, but once approved, it reset or changed to 0.00.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
The `payment.amountDue` field is **NOT** defined in the Booking schema (`src/models/Booking.js`). It's a computed/virtual field that needs to be dynamically calculated based on:
- `pricing.totalAmount` (the actual booking cost)
- `payment.status` (whether payment has been made)

### Formula
```javascript
payment.amountDue = (payment.status === 'paid') ? 0 : pricing.totalAmount
```

### Why It Was Failing
1. **Farmer booking endpoint** (`warehouse-booking.controller.js`) correctly enriched bookings with `payment.amountDue`
2. **Admin booking endpoint** (`admin.controller.js`) did NOT enrich the data
3. **Owner booking endpoint** (`booking.controller.js`) did NOT enrich the data

When the frontend fetched bookings after approval through admin/owner endpoints, the `payment.amountDue` field was undefined, causing the UI to display 0 or 0.00.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/controllers/admin.controller.js`
Fixed **4 functions**:

#### a) `getBookings` (lines 772-803)
- Added enrichment logic to map through bookings and set `payment.amountDue`
- Returns `enrichedBookings` instead of raw `bookings`

#### b) `getBookingById` (lines 814-839)
- Added `.lean()` to the query
- Calculated and set `payment.amountDue` before returning

#### c) `updateBookingStatus` (lines 893-986)
- Converts booking to plain object using `.toObject()`
- Calculates and sets `payment.amountDue` before sending response
- This ensures approval/rejection responses have correct payment values

### 2. `src/controllers/booking.controller.js`
Fixed **4 functions**:

#### a) `getBookings` (lines 259-290)
- Added enrichment logic identical to admin controller
- Returns `enrichedBookings` instead of raw `bookings`

#### b) `getBookingById` (lines 308-345)
- Added `.lean()` to the query
- Calculated and set `payment.amountDue` before returning

#### c) `approveBooking` (lines 521-538)
- Converts booking to plain object
- Calculates and sets `payment.amountDue` in response
- Ensures warehouse owner approval returns correct values

#### d) `rejectBooking` (lines 625-642)
- Converts booking to plain object
- Calculates and sets `payment.amountDue` in response
- Handles both 'paid' and 'refunded' status for amount calculation

## Technical Details

### Enrichment Logic Pattern
```javascript
// Ensure payment.amountDue is set for each booking
const enrichedBookings = bookings.map(booking => {
  if (!booking.payment) booking.payment = {};
  if (typeof booking.payment.amountDue !== 'number') {
    const total = booking.pricing?.totalAmount;
    if (typeof total === 'number') {
      booking.payment.amountDue = (booking.payment.status === 'paid') ? 0 : total;
    }
  }
  return booking;
});
```

### Single Booking Enrichment
```javascript
// Ensure payment.amountDue is set
if (!booking.payment) booking.payment = {};
if (typeof booking.payment.amountDue !== 'number') {
  const total = booking.pricing?.totalAmount;
  if (typeof total === 'number') {
    booking.payment.amountDue = (booking.payment.status === 'paid') ? 0 : total;
  }
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin Approval Flow**:
   - Create a booking as a farmer
   - Make payment (status: 'awaiting-approval')
   - Admin approves the booking
   - Verify payment amount displays correctly (not 0.00)

2. **Owner Approval Flow**:
   - Create a booking as a farmer
   - Make payment
   - Owner views booking request - verify payment shows
   - Owner approves booking
   - Verify payment amount remains correct

3. **Booking List Views**:
   - Check admin dashboard bookings tab
   - Check owner dashboard bookings
   - Check farmer "My Bookings" page
   - Verify all show correct payment amounts

4. **Individual Booking Details**:
   - View individual booking details through all user roles
   - Verify payment information displays correctly

## Impact
This fix ensures that `payment.amountDue` is consistently calculated and returned across all booking endpoints, resolving the issue where payment values showed as 0.00 after admin approval.

## No Frontend Changes Required
The frontend code is already correctly consuming the `payment.amountDue` field. The issue was purely backend - the field wasn't being populated in certain API responses.
