# Farm Monitoring Live Data Fix

## Problem
The farm monitoring system was experiencing live data fetching errors. The frontend was attempting to connect to the backend using standard WebSocket API, but the backend was implemented using Socket.IO, which has a different connection mechanism.

## Root Cause
The frontend implementation was using the standard WebSocket API:
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
```

While the backend was using Socket.IO:
```javascript
const io = new Server(httpServer, { ... });
```

These two technologies are not compatible with each other, which caused the connection to fail.

## Solution
Updated the frontend to use the Socket.IO client library instead of the standard WebSocket API.

### Changes Made

1. **Installed Socket.IO client library** in the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm install socket.io-client
   ```

2. **Updated the frontend FarmMonitoring component** to use Socket.IO:
   - Replaced WebSocket implementation with Socket.IO client
   - Updated connection logic to use `io()` instead of `new WebSocket()`
   - Updated event handling to use Socket.IO events instead of WebSocket events

3. **Updated the backend controller** to ensure proper event emission:
   - Added logging to verify when events are emitted
   - Ensured the Socket.IO instance is properly retrieved and used

### Key Code Changes

**Frontend (FarmMonitoring.jsx):**
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
const ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);

// After (correct)
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io(apiBaseUrl, {
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  withCredentials: true
});
```

**Backend (farm-monitoring.controller.js):**
```javascript
// Added logging to verify event emission
logger.info('Emitted sensorDataUpdate event via Socket.IO');
```

## Testing
1. Verified Socket.IO connection is established successfully
2. Confirmed that sensor data updates are properly emitted from the backend
3. Verified that the frontend receives and processes the updates correctly

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd FarmerAI-backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd farmerai-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the Farm Monitoring page in the browser
4. Observe that the connection status shows "Live" instead of "Offline"
5. Trigger a sensor data fetch and verify real-time updates appear

## Additional Improvements
- Added more detailed logging for debugging connection issues
- Improved error handling for connection failures
- Added automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Enhanced error messages to help with troubleshooting

## Conclusion
The live data fetching error has been resolved by aligning the frontend and backend to use the same real-time communication technology (Socket.IO). The farm monitoring system now properly receives and displays real-time sensor data updates.
