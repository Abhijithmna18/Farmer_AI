# API Client Fix Summary

## Issue
When clicking the delete button in the "Past Soil-Based Recommendations" table:
1. A 404 (Not Found) error was occurring at `http://localhost:5173/api/recommendations/soil/...`
2. The request was being sent to the frontend development server (5173) instead of the backend API server (5002)
3. This happened because the code was using the browser's native `fetch` API with a relative URL
4. The relative URL resolved to the current origin (frontend server) instead of the backend API

## Root Cause
The application was using the browser's native `fetch` API instead of the configured [apiClient](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\farmerai-frontend\src\services\apiClient.js#L5-L8) which has the correct base URL (`http://localhost:5002/api`).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing API Functions
- Added `deleteSoilRecommendation` function to [recommendationService.js](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\farmerai-frontend\src\services\recommendationService.js)
- Added `updateSoilRecommendation` function to [recommendationService.js](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\farmerai-frontend\src\services\recommendationService.js)
- Both functions use the proper [apiClient](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\farmerai-frontend\src\services\apiClient.js#L5-L8) with correct base URL

### 2. Updated Component to Use Proper API Client
- Replaced native `fetch` calls with [recommendationService](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\farmerai-frontend\src\services\recommendationService.js) functions
- Ensured consistent API usage across the application
- Leveraged existing authentication and error handling

### 3. Files Modified
- [farmerai-frontend/src/services/recommendationService.js](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\farmerai-frontend\src\services\recommendationService.js) - Added delete and update functions
- [farmerai-frontend/src/pages/Recommendations.jsx](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\farmerai-frontend\src\pages\Recommendations.jsx) - Updated to use proper API client

## Key Improvements

### Delete Button
- Now uses `recommendationService.deleteSoilRecommendation` instead of `fetch`
- Requests are sent to the correct backend API URL (`http://localhost:5002/api`)
- Token authentication is handled automatically
- Better error handling with axios response structure

### Edit Save Button
- Now uses `recommendationService.updateSoilRecommendation` instead of `fetch`
- Requests are sent to the correct backend API URL (`http://localhost:5002/api`)
- Token authentication is handled automatically
- Better error handling with axios response structure

### Soil Results Save Button
- Now uses `recommendationService.updateSoilRecommendation` instead of `fetch`
- Requests are sent to the correct backend API URL (`http://localhost:5002/api`)
- Token authentication is handled automatically
- Better error handling with axios response structure

## Benefits of Using apiClient

1. **Correct Base URL**: All requests automatically use `http://localhost:5002/api`
2. **Automatic Authentication**: Tokens are added to headers automatically
3. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across the application
4. **Request/Response Interceptors**: Logging and debugging capabilities
5. **Timeout Handling**: Prevents hanging requests with 10-second timeout
6. **Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh for 401 errors

## Testing Results

All implementations have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Delete function added to recommendation service
- ✅ Update function added to recommendation service
- ✅ Recommendations component uses proper API client

## Result

The API client issue is now resolved:
1. **No more 404 errors** - Requests are sent to the correct backend server
2. **Proper authentication** - Tokens are handled automatically
3. **Consistent with application patterns** - Uses the same approach as other API calls
4. **Better error handling** - Leverages existing axios error handling

Users will now have a seamless experience when managing their soil-based recommendations history without encountering incorrect API endpoint errors.
