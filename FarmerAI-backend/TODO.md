## Debugging Steps
- [ ] Verify admin dashboard route exists in frontend routing

- [ ] Ensure proper role-based redirection logic

## Potential Fixes Needed

- [ ] Implement admin dashboard component if missing
- [ ] Fix authentication context role handling
- [ ] Ensure proper protected route logic for admin
- [ ] Test complete admin login flow
