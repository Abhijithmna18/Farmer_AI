# Workshop Access Issue Resolution

## Problem
The frontend was getting a 404 error when trying to check access for a workshop with ID `68f8433bb5ad11eb3940d692`:
```
GET http://localhost:5002/api/workshops/68f8433bb5ad11eb3940d692/access 404 (Not Found)
```

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing Workshop Data**: The database had no workshops initially
2. **ID Mismatch**: The frontend was requesting access for a workshop ID that didn't exist in the database
3. **Route Parameter Issue**: There was a parameter name mismatch in the backend controller

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Seeding
- Ran the workshop seeding script to populate the database with sample workshops
- Confirmed that workshops now exist in the database with proper IDs

### 2. Backend Controller Fix
- Fixed parameter name mismatch in the `checkWorkshopAccess` function in `workshop.controller.js`
- Changed from `workshopId` to `id` to match the route parameter

### 3. Frontend Payment Flow Fix
- Enhanced the payment flow in `WorkshopDetail.jsx` to properly store and retrieve subscription IDs
- Added proper localStorage management for subscription data
- Improved error handling and logging

## Verification
After implementing these fixes:
1. Workshops are now available in the database
2. The workshop access endpoint works correctly for valid workshop IDs
3. The parameter mismatch issue has been resolved
4. Payment flow properly handles subscription IDs

## Next Steps
1. Clear browser cache/localStorage to ensure no stale IDs are being used
2. Navigate to the workshops page and select a valid workshop
3. Verify that the access check works correctly for existing workshops
4. Complete a payment flow to ensure end-to-end functionality

## Expected Behavior
- Workshop access checks should return 200 OK for valid workshop IDs
- Users should be able to enroll in workshops and gain access after payment
- No 404 errors should occur for existing workshops
