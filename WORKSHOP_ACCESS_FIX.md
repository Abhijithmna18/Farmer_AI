# Workshop Access Fix Summary

## Issue
After successful subscription payment, users were getting a 404 error when trying to check access for workshops:
```
GET http://localhost:5002/api/workshops/68f8433…/access 404 (Not Found)
```

## Root Causes Identified
1. Parameter name mismatch in backend controller - using `workshopId` instead of `id`
2. Incorrect access to subscriptionId in frontend payment verification
3. Missing storage and retrieval of subscriptionId during payment flow

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend Controller Fix (`FarmerAI-backend/src/controllers/workshop.controller.js`)
- Fixed parameter name mismatch in [checkWorkshopAccess](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\FarmerAI-backend\src\controllers\workshop.controller.js#L338-L381) function
- Changed `workshopId` to `id` to match the route parameter
- Updated all references to the parameter within the function

### 2. Frontend Payment Flow Fix (`farmerai-frontend/src/pages/WorkshopDetail.jsx`)
- Added proper storage of subscriptionId in localStorage when creating order
- Fixed access to subscriptionId during payment verification
- Added cleanup of localStorage after successful payment
- Enhanced logging for debugging payment flow

## Verification Steps
1. Navigate to a premium workshop detail page
2. Click "Enroll for ₹X"
3. Complete Razorpay payment flow
4. Verify payment confirmation is sent
5. Check that access to workshop is granted
6. Confirm "Watch Now" button appears
7. Verify no 404 errors in console

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. Workshop access check endpoint works correctly
2. Payment flow completes successfully
3. Users gain access to purchased workshops
4. UI updates properly to show access granted
5. No errors in browser console related to workshop access
