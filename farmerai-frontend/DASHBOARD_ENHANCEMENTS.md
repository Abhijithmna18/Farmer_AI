- Grid layouts adapt from 1-2 columns on mobile to 3-4 on desktop

## Performance Considerations
- GSAP animations optimized for smooth 60fps
- Lazy loading of calendar data
- Efficient re-renders with proper React hooks
- CSS transforms for hardware-accelerated animations

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

8. Include farm analytics dashboard

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Verify all animations perform smoothly
3. Check data loading states
4. Test hover effects on all interactive elements
5. Verify color contrast for accessibility
6. Test with different amounts of calendar data
7. Verify translation keys work correctly

## Accessibility Improvements

## How to Use
1. The enhanced dashboard will automatically load when navigating to `/dashboard`
2. All existing functionality is preserved
3. New statistics are calculated from existing calendar data
4. DashboardSummary component displays mock data (can be connected to real APIs)
