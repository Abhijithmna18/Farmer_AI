# Session/Caching Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
When one user logs out and a new user logs in on the same browser, the new user's dashboard incorrectly displays the previous user's data. This is a data-caching problem where old user data is not being properly cleared upon logout.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Incomplete cache clearing on logout** - localStorage and sessionStorage were cleared but browser cache was not
2. **Component state persistence** - Dashboard component was not resetting its state when a new user logged in
3. **API client caching** - Axios requests could be cached by the browser
4. **User-specific data not scoped properly** - Some data was stored globally rather than per-user
5. **CORS configuration** - Backend didn't allow cache control headers

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. AuthContext.jsx
- Enhanced logout function to clear browser cache in addition to localStorage/sessionStorage
- Added cache clearing using `caches.delete()` API
- Ensured proper cleanup of authentication tokens and user data

### 2. Dashboard.jsx
- Modified useEffect to depend on user changes, ensuring fresh data fetch for each user
- Added error handling to reset state when data fetch fails
- Scoped localStorage usage to current user (e.g., `lastEvent_${user.id}`)

### 3. apiClient.js
- Disabled caching for all API requests by setting appropriate headers
- Added `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Pragma: no-cache`, and `Expires: 0` headers
- Added a `clearCache()` method to programmatically clear browser cache

### 4. server.js (Backend)
- Updated CORS configuration to allow cache control headers
- Added `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, and `Expires` to allowed headers

### 5. LogoutButton.jsx
- Integrated cache clearing functionality into the logout process
- Added call to apiClient.clearCache() and browser cache clearing
- Ensured complete cleanup before redirecting to login page

### 6. BookingCartContext.jsx
- Added useEffect to clear cart items when user changes
- Ensures shopping cart data doesn't persist between users

## Key Changes Summary

### Cache Control Headers
```javascript
// Added to all API requests
config.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache";
config.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache";
config.headers["Expires"] = "0";
```

### Browser Cache Clearing
```javascript
// Clear browser cache if available
if ('caches' in window) {
  caches.keys().then(names => {
    names.forEach(name => {
      caches.delete(name);
    });
  });
}
```

### User-Scoped Data
```javascript
// Store user-specific data with user ID
localStorage.getItem(`lastEvent_${user.id || user._id || user.email}`);
```

### Component State Reset
```javascript
// Reset state when user changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) {
    setCartItems([]);
  }
}, [user]);
```

### CORS Configuration (Backend)
```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: allowedOrigins,
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'Cache-Control', 'Pragma', 'Expires'],
  exposedHeaders: ['x-rtb-fingerprint-id']
};
```

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix works:
1. Log in as User A
2. Navigate to dashboard and observe User A's data
3. Log out as User A
4. Log in as User B
5. Navigate to dashboard - should show User B's data or empty state
6. Log out as User B
7. Log in as User A again - should show User A's data

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Backend Validation** - Ensure all API endpoints validate user permissions
2. **JWT Token Management** - Implement proper token refresh and expiration handling
3. **Service Worker Cache** - If using service workers, implement proper cache invalidation
4. **IndexedDB Cleanup** - If using IndexedDB, clear user-specific data on logout

## Files Modified
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
- `src/services/apiClient.js`
- `src/components/LogoutButton.jsx`
- `src/context/BookingCartContext.jsx`
- `FarmerAI-backend/server.js`

This comprehensive fix ensures that when a user logs out, all their data is properly cleared and the next user will see only their own data.
