# üîß Farm Monitoring - Redirect Issue Fix

## Problem
Clicking on "Farm Monitoring" was redirecting to the welcome page instead of showing the dashboard.

## Root Cause
**Wrong import path in `farmMonitoring.service.js`**

The service was trying to import from:
```javascript
import apiClient from '../config/apiClient';  // ‚ùå Wrong path
```

But `apiClient` is actually located in the `services` directory, not `config`.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

Fixed the import path in `farmerai-frontend/src/services/farmMonitoring.service.js`:

```javascript
import apiClient from './apiClient';  // ‚úÖ Correct path
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Frontend
```bash
cd farmerai-frontend

# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click on the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

OR simply:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear cache
- **Firefox**: Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear cache

### Step 3: Test Navigation
1. Login to your FarmerAI application
2. Look for "Farm Monitoring" in the sidebar (4th item under "Main")
3. Click on it
4. You should now see the Farm Monitoring dashboard ‚úÖ

## Expected Behavior

After the fix, when you click "Farm Monitoring":

‚úÖ **Should see**: Farm Monitoring dashboard page with:
- Header: "üåæ Farm Monitoring"
- "Fetch New Data" button
- Time range selector
- Empty state message (if no data yet)

‚ùå **Should NOT see**: Redirect to welcome page or login page

## If Still Having Issues

### Check 1: Authentication
Make sure you're logged in:
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
console.log(localStorage.getItem('token'));
// Should show a JWT token string, not null
```

### Check 2: API Endpoint
Verify backend is running and endpoint exists:
```bash
# In browser console or terminal:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/farm-monitoring/latest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Should return 404 or 401 (not 500)
```

### Check 3: Browser Console Errors
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any red errors
4. Common errors and fixes:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `Cannot find module './apiClient'` | Restart dev server |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Re-login to get new token |
| `404 Not Found` | Ensure backend server is running |
| `Network Error` | Check backend is on port 5000 |

### Check 4: Route Configuration
Verify the route is properly configured in `App.jsx`:
```javascript
<Route path="farm-monitoring" element={<FarmMonitoring />} />
```

Should be inside the `<Route element={<SidebarLayout />}>` block.

## What Was Changed

### File Modified
- ‚úÖ `farmerai-frontend/src/services/farmMonitoring.service.js`

### Change Made
```diff
- import apiClient from '../config/apiClient';
+ import apiClient from './apiClient';
```

## Additional Notes

### Why This Caused a Redirect

When the import failed:
1. JavaScript threw an error trying to load the component
2. React Router caught the error
3. The ProtectedRoute component couldn't render properly
4. It defaulted to redirecting to the login/welcome page

### How the Fix Works

Now with the correct import path:
1. `apiClient` is successfully imported
2. The FarmMonitoring component renders without errors
3. The protected route allows access
4. Dashboard displays correctly

## Testing Checklist

After applying the fix:

- [ ] Frontend restarted
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Logged in to the application
- [ ] Can see "Farm Monitoring" in sidebar
- [ ] Clicking it shows the dashboard (not welcome page)
- [ ] "Fetch New Data" button is visible
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ **URL changes** to: `http://localhost:5173/farm-monitoring`
2. ‚úÖ **Page shows** the Farm Monitoring header and UI
3. ‚úÖ **No redirect** back to `/` or `/login`
4. ‚úÖ **Sidebar item** is highlighted/active

## Still Need Help?

If the issue persists:

1. **Check backend logs** - Is the server running?
2. **Check network tab** - Are API calls being made?
3. **Check token** - Is it valid and not expired?
4. **Restart both servers** - Sometimes a full restart helps
