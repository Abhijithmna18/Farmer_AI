# Delete Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue
When clicking the delete button in the "Past Soil-Based Recommendations" table:
1. A 404 (Not Found) error was occurring
2. Items were still shown in the table after deletion
3. No proper error handling or user feedback

## Root Cause
The delete functionality was not properly handling HTTP responses and was not reloading the data after successful operations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper HTTP response checking with `response.ok`
- Added JSON error response parsing for better error messages
- Added network error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added console logging for debugging purposes

### 2. Data Refresh
- Added `await load()` call after successful delete operations
- Ensured the UI updates to reflect the deletion
- Added proper state management for data consistency

### 3. User Experience
- Added success toast notifications
- Added error toast notifications with specific messages
- Maintained loading states during operations

### 4. Files Modified
- [farmerai-frontend/src/pages/Recommendations.jsx](file://d:\New%20folder\intern\Farmer_AI\farmerai-frontend\src\pages\Recommendations.jsx) - Updated delete, update, and save functionality

## Key Improvements
